# ImmoEliza
First group project between the Kellers (web dev promotion) and the Turings (AI promotion).

The purpose of this project is to create an application for the client ImmoEliza, with a form to predict the price of a house or apartment.


### Who

##### AI
- Be able to create a prediction model
- Be able to deploy your model
